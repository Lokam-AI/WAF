# Lokam Project Scaffolding System

To streamline the development of Proof of Concepts (POCs) and Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) for our clients at Lokam, we can establish a standardized, scalable, and modular project scaffolding system. This system will cater to the three primary use cases:

## Use Cases

1. **Regular Chatbot**
   - Utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM) to respond to user inputs.

2. **RAG-based Chatbot**
   - Combining LLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques
   - Incorporating vector databases for context-rich responses

3. **MCP AI Agent**
   - An agent with Model Context Protocol (MCP) capabilities
   - Connecting to multiple data sources and systems to perform specific tasks

## Implementation Guide

### 1. Standardized Tech Stack

#### Frontend
- **React**: For building user interfaces
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first CSS styling
- **Vite**: As the build tool for faster development

#### Backend
- **FastAPI**: For building high-performance APIs
- **PostgreSQL**: As the primary relational database
- **pgvector**: An extension for PostgreSQL to handle vector embeddings

#### Additional Tools
- **Docker**: For containerization
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI

### 2. Modular Project Templates

#### a. Regular Chatbot Template
- Backend:
  - FastAPI setup with routes to handle user inputs
  - Integration with chosen LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Claude, Gemini)
- Frontend:
  - React components for chat interface
  - Tailwind CSS for styling

#### b. RAG-based Chatbot Template
- Backend:
  - FastAPI setup with routes for document ingestion and querying
  - Integration with vector database using pgvector
  - Embedding generation using models like OpenAI's embeddings or SentenceTransformers
- Frontend:
  - React components for document upload and chat interface
  - Tailwind CSS for styling

#### c. MCP AI Agent Template
- Backend:
  - FastAPI setup with MCP server and client implementations
  - Connectors to various data sources and systems
- Frontend:
  - React components to monitor and interact with the agent
  - Tailwind CSS for styling

### 3. CLI Tool for Project Initialization

Create a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool (`lokam-cli`) to automate project setup:

#### Features
- Project type selection (Regular Chatbot, RAG-based Chatbot, MCP AI Agent)
- Project structure generation with pre-configured frontend and backend
- Git repository initialization and dependency installation
- Docker configuration setup
- CI/CD pipeline integration

#### Implementation
- Built using Python's click or argparse libraries
- Distributed internally via PyPI or as standalone executable

### 4. CI/CD Pipelines

#### Testing
- Backend testing with pytest
- Frontend testing with Jest

#### Deployment
- Docker containerization
- AWS deployment (ECS or EKS)
- Automated build and deployment via GitHub Actions or GitLab CI

### 5. Documentation and Training
- Maintain comprehensive documentation for templates and CLI tool
- Conduct development team training sessions

### 6. Feedback and Iteration
- Gather feedback from developers and clients
- Iterate on templates and tools to improve usability and performance# WAF
